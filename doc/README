INTRODUCTION
    itsy is a minimalistic view-controller PHP framework.

    Most of the itsy classes can be used without firing up the whole framework.
    Take what you need; discard the rest.

    At the moment the exact requirements float about a bit, basically this is what
    I'm testing with, other configurations may also work.

        - PHP Version: 5.2.6
